YaBT-Yet-another-Bug-Tracker
============================

Core Data demo project which shows the latest techniques for Concurrency in Core Data, with 3 levels of
parent/child managed object contexts.  When you run the project, you will see simulated "Product" objects
being added, as if from the network, every 20 seconds.  Requires Xcode 6+, iOS 8 SDK.

This project will be discussed at a Meetup at Sandbox Suites, 888 E. Arques Ave. Sunnyvale CA on Tuesday
Sept 9 2014 at 7:00 PM.  I'll probably make a few more changes between now and then :)
